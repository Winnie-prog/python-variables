Learning Python Variables
This repository documents my journey learning how to use variables in Python through practical exercises in Jupyter Notebook.

What I Learned
I explored how variables work as containers for storing different types of data, such as integers, strings, and lists. By experimenting with assigning and reassigning values, I developed an understanding of Python’s dynamic typing and how it automatically detects data types.

I also practiced:

Creating and printing variables

Using multiple assignments in one line

Understanding case sensitivity in variable names

Applying naming conventions like snake_case, camelCase, and PascalCase to write readable and professional code

Concatenating strings and combining different data types correctly in print statements

Identifying common errors, such as attempting to add strings and integers directly

Why This Matters to Me
Variables are fundamental to programming in any language, and mastering their use in Python helped me build a strong foundation. This hands-on practice increased my confidence writing clear and error-free Python code, which I’m excited to apply in real-world projects.

How I Worked
I used Jupyter Notebook to write and run Python code in an interactive environment, which allowed me to test concepts step-by-step and see immediate results. This iterative approach helped me deepen my understanding of how Python handles variables and data types.

Next Steps
I plan to continue building on this foundation by exploring functions, control flow, and working with more complex data structures to become a proficient Python developer.

About Me
I’m a passionate learner dedicated to mastering Python programming and data analysis. I enjoy solving problems and creating clean, efficient code.
